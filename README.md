<h1>An Ogre3D example code</h1>

The main goal of this project is to render a graphic example using Ogre3D, a framework

This project was made to be graded at the course of Computer Graphics [1], lectured by

<h3>About Ogre3D</h3>

OGRE (Object-Oriented Graphics Rendering Engine) is a scene-oriented, flexible 3D engine written in C++ designed to make it easier and more intuitive for developers to produce applications utilising hardware-accelerated 3D graphics. The class library abstracts all the details of using the underlying system libraries like Direct3D and OpenGL and provides an interface based on world objects and other intuitive classes.<br>
